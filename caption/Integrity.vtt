00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:10.477
<v Washington>Go now, now!</v>

2
00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.864
<v Voiceover>In the eight and a half years that Washington</v>

3
00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:17.635
commands the Revolutionary Army, he continually demonstrates

4
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.344
how he expects no less from his troops

5
00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:22.256
than he demands from himself.

6
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.975
<v ->[Lt. General Dave R. Palmer] He took no salary</v>

7
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.744
for as long as he fought.

8
00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:29.880
He let the states pay his expenses,

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.050
but he would take no salary.

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.551
He never went home.

11
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:36.820
He stayed with his troops the entire time.

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.689
He never led from the rear.

13
00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:41.392 line:15% 
He was up front when he shouldn't have been,

14
00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:44.161 line:15% 
but he thought it was necessary to

15
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.762 line:15% 
swing the battle when victory or defeat was in the balance.

16
00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.040
(gunshots, yelling)

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.103
He would not take rewards at the end of the war.

18
00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:54.688
He was totally a selfless leader.

19
00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.444
<v Voiceover>In 1783, after a peace treaty is signed</v>

20
00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:02.980
with Britain, Washington appears before

21
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.784
the Continental Congress and offiicially resigns his post

22
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:08.986
as Commander in Chief.

23
00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:12.656
<v Washington>Having now finished the work assigned to me,</v>

24
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.559
I retire from the great theater of action.

25
00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:19.631
Bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body

26
00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:23.934
under whose orders I have so long acted.

27
00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:27.037
<v Voiceover>Washington refuses to become a king.</v>

28
00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:31.528
His resignation was a radical departure for the time.

29
00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.177
Washington set a precedent for all

30
00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:35.746
American generals to follow.

31
00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:38.716
That the military would obey political leaders

32
00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:41.352
and not vice versa.

33
00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:44.391
<v Voiceover>He gave us a tradition.</v>

34
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:48.258
To not have any divine right of authority over the people.

35
00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:53.130
And that the military has to be a people's army.

36
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.749
It has to be responsiticity and leadership.

37
00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:00.804
<v Voiceover>Washington's decision to relinquish power</v>

38
00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:04.375
happens twice, not just as commander in chief,

39
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.678
but also after two terms as president of the United States.

40
00:02:07.678 --> 00:02:10.547
(crowd applauding)

41
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.622
His return to civilian life becomes a cornerstone

42
00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:15.335
of American democracy.
