00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:09.181
(heroic music)

2
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.006
<v Voiceover>It's 1753,</v>

3
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.607
and a brash 21-year-old George Washington

4
00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:15.539
gets his first military assignment

5
00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.509
in the wilderness of Indian country.

6
00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.838
(heroic music)

7
00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:22.489
<v Washington>I recall when I was</v>

8
00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.274
a young officer in the Virginia Regiment,

9
00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:26.511
I was commissioned and appointed

10
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:29.328
by the Governor of Virginia to visit and deliver

11
00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.861
a letter to the commandant of the French forces on the Ohio,

12
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.135
and set out on the intended journey the same day.

13
00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:40.463
(heroic music)

14
00:00:40.463 --> 00:00:41.699
<v ->He's full of himself.</v>

15
00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.619
He's just been made a lieutenant colonel.

16
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:45.540
He's leading Virginia troops.

17
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.617 line:15% 
He's the commander.

18
00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:49.241 line:15% 
He's going out with an expedition to fight

19
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:51.705 line:15% 
the French forces out that way.

20
00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:53.838
He's probably pretty proud of himself.

21
00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:56.739
He doesn't know what he doesn't know.

22
00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.790
He's not had military schooling, and he may have thought

23
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.198
he was a lot more competent than he really was.

24
00:01:02.198 --> 00:01:04.905
(ominous music)

25
00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.326
<v Washington>We have, with nature's assistance,</v>

26
00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:08.926
made a good entrenchment,

27
00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.040
and by clearing the bushes out of these meadows

28
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.963
prepared a charming field for an encounter.

29
00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:19.963
(ominous music)

30
00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.141
<v Voiceover>But the encounter is far from charming.</v>

31
00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:27.264
Washington has the fort built on low ground,

32
00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:28.881
where it can be easily attacked.

33
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:33.456
(solemn music)

34
00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:35.493
<v Washington>"About 9 o'clock on the 3rd of July,</v>

35
00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:38.821
the enemy advanced with shouts and dismal Indian yells

36
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.531
to our entrenchments.

37
00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:44.504
They then, from every literal rise and tree,

38
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.896
stump, stone, and bush kept up a constant

39
00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:49.677
scalding fire upon us."

40
00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:53.473
(solemn music)

41
00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:55.042
<v Voiceover>In just a few short hours,</v>

42
00:01:55.042 --> 00:01:57.071
Washington is soundly defeated.

43
00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.739
Out of 305 men, 31 were killed and 70 wounded.

44
00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:05.407
(solemn music)

45
00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:07.007
<v Palmer>He deals with the French commander,</v>

46
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.972
and they let him march back with his weapons

47
00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:12.500
if he promises to go back to Virginia.

48
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.800
He has no choice.

49
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.577
So he goes back a defeated officer in his first campaign.

50
00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:20.296
(solemn music)

51
00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.066
<v ->With every failure he learned,</v>

52
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.850
and learned from that failure to do better next time,

53
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.794
and with a determination.

54
00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:28.797 line:15% 
He was persistent.

55
00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:29.542 line:15% 
He never gave up.

56
00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.289 line:15% 
He never quit, even in the midst of failure.

57
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:37.551
(heroic music)
