1
00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:09.483
<v Lt. Palmer>As most people know, Washington</v>

2
00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:12.844
had his eye on the West, from his young ages.

3
00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.190 line:15% 
He personally, went out three different times,

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.088 line:15% 
<v Washington>Get ready!</v>
<v Lt. Palmer>to fight</v>

5
00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:21.181
the French, in the area around Pittsburgh.

6
00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:24.223
After the Revolution, he made a trip

7
00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.962
and went down the Ohio River,

8
00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:28.403
checking out the land, what was it like?

9
00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:31.398
He didn't see the America in his vision

10
00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.227
as being just the Atlantic Front.

11
00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:37.182
He was always looking west.

12
00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:39.875
<v Voiceover>By 1760, Americans are already moving</v>

13
00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.361
west of the Alleghenies.

14
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.827
Washington realizes these numbers will grow.

15
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:48.316
So he helps create the Potomac Company.

16
00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:51.725
It hopes to connect the Eastern Seaboard,

17
00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.971
with the resource-rich Ohio Valley,

18
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.930
by improving navigation along the Potomac River.

19
00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:00.253
<v ->And then of course, if that ever happens,</v>

20
00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:02.921 line:15% 
it's all gonna be coming out of the Port of Alexandria

21
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:05.405 line:15% 
Which is just down the road from Mt. Vernon.

22
00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:06.472
So it's a win/win.

23
00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:08.681
It's good for the country, it's good for Virginia,

24
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:10.696
and it's good for Mt. Vernon.

25
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Voiceover>The Potomac Company fails</v>

26
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.192
as a business venture.

27
00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:17.917
In part, because of daunting engineering challenges

28
00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.207
along the route.

29
00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:22.097
But Washington's vision of a nation

30
00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.070
stretching across the continent,

31
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.808
never diminishes.

32
00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:30.875
He advocates putting the nation's capitol

33
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.030
on the banks of the Potomac,

34
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.874
convinced it will be a primary route westward.

35
00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:41.212
And, in 1792, Washington welcomes Kentucky,

36
00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:43.280
and then Tennessee into the Union.

37
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.812
The first states beyond the Allegheny Mountains.

38
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.377
<v Lt. Palmer>All of his life, if you imagine him</v>

39
00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:52.203
standing at Mt. Vernon, and looking to what

40
00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:55.628
he saw as the future, he was facing west.

41
00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.035
He saw it, he believed it, he lived it.

42
00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:01.451
He was not facing east, toward Europe.

43
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:03.513
He was a man of America.
