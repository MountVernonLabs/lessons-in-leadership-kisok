<v ->People who really study Washington</v>

2
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.840 line:15% 
recognize that he had a rare trait,

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.670 line:15% 
rarer than rare today

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.570 line:15% 
and that was vision and the ability to see

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.670
what could be done and to embrace change.

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.670
<v Voiceover>Washington's passion is farming.</v>

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.470
Most of his Mount Vernon acreage,

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.150
like that of his neighbors,

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.520
is planted with tobacco.

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420
Tobacco can be lucrative but it is highly regulated

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.860
by the British.

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.600
So profits vary wildly.

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.070
It is also difficult to grow in the fragile Virginia soil.

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Dave>So he wasn't worried about the prestige</v>

15
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.800
of being a tobacco farmer.

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.920
He was interested in making his plantation pay for itself.

17
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.310
It was a business.

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.560
And Washington just decided there's got to be a better way.

19
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Voiceover>Starting in 1766, Washington abandons tobacco</v>

20
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.310
as his main cash crop,

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.450
one of the first Tidewater plantation owners to do so.

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.560
He replaces it with crops like corn, wheat, and flax.

23
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.830
Domestic crops for domestic consumption.

24
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Dave>That's when he became really wealthy</v>

25
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.170
when he started doing that rather than serving

26
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.570
the British need to import tobacco

27
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.330
which was a loser in America at that time.

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.050 line:15% 
<v ->You've got to constantly be innovating.</v>

29
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.710
(dramatic music)

30
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.850
You've got to constantly ask yourself,

31
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.930
"Isn't there a better way to do this?"

32
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Voiceover>For George Washington the farm at Mount Vernon</v>

33
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.520
is a work in progress.

34
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.730
He never stopped searching for improvements

35
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.860
whether borrowed or self-generated.

36
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.630
He designs a better plow, one that won't get stuck

37
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.840
in the farm's clay soil.

38
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.270
He builds a threshing barn that revolutionizes

39
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.500
wheat production.

40
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.780
And when a patent application for an automated gristmill

41
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.800
comes across his Presidential desk,

42
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.550
he not only approves it but immediately orders one

43
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.890
for Mount Vernon.

44
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Jim>In some ways George Washington was the</v>

45
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.620
Steve Jobs of his time.

46
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.020
It was not technology for technology's sake.

47
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.690
It was technology in service of human advancement.

48
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.900
(upbeat banjo music)

49
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Voiceover>In the last years of his life,</v>

50
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.350
Washington decides to add a distillery to Mount Vernon's

51
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.020
growing list of business ventures.

52
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.550
It quickly becomes the biggest and most profitable

53
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.870
whiskey distillery in America.

54
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.860
<v ->One of the reasons I think George Washington created</v>

55
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.420 line:15% 
a distillery was a classic business principle

56
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.330
which is take something and add value to it.

57
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.140
He had grain there at Mount Vernon.

58
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.460
Now grain is heavy, difficult to transport,

59
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.300
subject to spoilage.

60
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.810
But if you take that grain

61
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.240
and change it into whiskey

62
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.180
you've got something much more compact.

63
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.020
The nutrition is much denser.

64
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.190
It doesn't spoil.

65
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.020
It's easy to transport.

66
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.690 line:15% 
And those two things enabled him

67
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.410 line:15% 
to make higher value added product.

68
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.000
Washington was a visionary.

69
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.600
He spent years of his life

70
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.590
fighting for ideals that he had.

71
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.770
But he was also a supremely practical man.

72
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.060
He got his hands dirty whenever it was necessary.

73
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.930
That's the most inspiring thing about him to me.
