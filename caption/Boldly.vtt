(heroic music)

2
00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:11.876
<v Voiceover>It's 1776.</v>

3
00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:15.694
The Revolutionary War is going badly.

4
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.297
Troop morale is low.

5
00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:21.688
General Washington has to act.

6
00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:26.381
<v Washington>"Our situation is truly distressing.</v>

7
00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:30.237
"The militia, instead of calling forth their utmost efforts

8
00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:32.776
"to a brave and manly opposition,

9
00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:37.346
"are dismayed, intractable, and impatient to return."

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:40.488 line:15% 
<v ->By the end of 1776, Washington has been</v>

11
00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:42.813 line:15% 
driven out of New York City and he has been

12
00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:45.352 line:15% 
driven out of New Jersey.

13
00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:48.535
He's across the Delaware River on the Pennsylvania side.

14
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:53.345
People in New Jersey are signing British loyalty oaths.

15
00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:56.619
It really looks like this could be it.

16
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:00.935
<v Washington>"Your imagination can scarce extend</v>

17
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:04.150
"to a situation more distressing than mine.

18
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.671
"Our only dependence now is upon the

19
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:09.319
"speedy enlistment of a new army.

20
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.538
"If this fails, I think the game will be

21
00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:14.611
"pretty well up."

22
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.262
(heroic music)

23
00:01:18.262 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Voiceover>Washington decides on a surprise</v>

24
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.130
Christmas Eve attack on a garrison in Trenton, New Jersey.

25
00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:26.083
that is held by Hessians, allies of the British.

26
00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:30.979
But first his troops must cross the icy Delaware River.

27
00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:36.418
<v Richard>Two of the units never make it across.</v>

28
00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:39.042
Washington's does.

29
00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.351
Now the Hessians were good, professional soldiers.

30
00:01:43.912 --> 00:01:47.421
But they had had a number of false reports

31
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:49.419
of attacks during the night.

32
00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:53.863 line:15% 
They were convinced that, "All right,

33
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.044 line:15% 
"nothing is really going to happen."

34
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.882 line:15% 
So it was an intelligence failure.

35
00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:01.114
(heroic music)

36
00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:02.415
<v ->Well, crossing the Delaware created</v>

37
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.113
and element of surprise when the Hessians were caught,

38
00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:06.948 line:15% 
because they didn't think anybody was going to be

39
00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:08.506 line:15% 
dumb enough to cross the Delaware

40
00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:09.870 line:15% 
in the middle of the winter.

41
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.652 line:15% 
So the element of surprise is not something

42
00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:14.345 line:15% 
Washington invented, but he used it very effectively.

43
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:16.840 line:15% 
It is classical military theory.

44
00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:21.854
(heroic music)

45
00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:25.762
<v Voiceover>The success of the Trenton attack</v>

46
00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:27.543
inspires his soldiers.

47
00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:30.060
Though entitled to go home at the end of the year,

48
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.235
they stay on to continue their pursuit of the British.

49
00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:36.221
(heroic music)

50
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:38.514 line:15% 
<v ->Instead of saying, "Okay, I've won a great victory.</v>

51
00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:41.468 line:15% 
"Now we'll go into winter quarters," or something,

52
00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:44.146 line:15% 
he drives deep into New Jersey

53
00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:49.146
by attacking at Trenton, meeting the British at Princeton,

54
00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:52.272
and by going to the mountains in northern New Jersey.

55
00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:56.060
In those 10 days he has completely reversed

56
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.627
the tide of war.

57
00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:01.835
(heroic music)
