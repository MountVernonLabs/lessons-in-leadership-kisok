(heroic music)

2
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:13.534
<v Voiceover>February 1777, the Continental Army</v>

3
00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.918
settles into winter encampments at Morristown, New Jersey.

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.636
Hard-won victories at Trenton and Princeton

5
00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:22.988
have turned the tide of war in their favor.

6
00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.737
(heroic music)

7
00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:27.728
But General Washington now faces an enemy

8
00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:30.549
more dangerous than any British soldier.

9
00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.099 line:15% 
<v ->In that day and age it was normal</v>

10
00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:38.310 line:15% 
that armies lost more men to disease

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.126 line:15% 
than they did to battle.

12
00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.434
The worst of the worst was smallpox.

13
00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:46.415
(heroic music)

14
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:49.722
<v ->When the Revolutionary War begins,</v>

15
00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:53.529
this is an extremely unsettling event.

16
00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:56.878 line:15% 
You have American soldiers being called

17
00:00:56.878 --> 00:00:59.514 line:15% 
from all the 13 colonies.

18
00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:01.391
So all of a sudden you have these people

19
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:06.222
who have lived either in tiny cities or in farms,

20
00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:09.977
and they're all together in camps by the thousands.

21
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:13.272
So the infection rates from smallpox

22
00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.719
suddenly starts spiking.

23
00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:19.223
<v Voiceover>Inoculation is risky.</v>

24
00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:23.140
Live smallpox virus is rubbed into an open wound.

25
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.687
Washington knows a small percentage of his men

26
00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.470
will die from the procedure.

27
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.927
But without it, he could lose most of them.

28
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:35.581
<v Richard>And he has to keep it secret from the British,</v>

29
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:38.739
because if the British learn that one-third

30
00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:41.907
of the American army is not effective because

31
00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:45.427
they're recovering from their inoculations,

32
00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:47.341
they might try a winter attack.

33
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.135
So this all has to be done on the sly.

34
00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.386
It all has to be done quietly.

35
00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:58.247
It's a huge feat of organization.

36
00:01:58.247 --> 00:02:01.820
The result of it is that the Continental forces

37
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.193
under Washington are safe from this terrible disease.

38
00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:10.869
(heroic music)
